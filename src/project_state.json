  "summary": "Scope expanded/shifted to include building a standalone single-page interactive Valentine’s Day website (HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript) with a light background, GIF-driven UI, dynamic Yes/No button behavior (No cycles phrases and scales buttons), GIF swap after several No clicks, and a Yes flow that clears the screen, shows a celebratory GIF + heading, and triggers confetti (canvas-confetti), with responsive mobile-first layout and cute Google Fonts.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Project includes an ICP canister backend written in Motoko with generated Candid/TypeScript declaration bindings consumed by the React frontend.",
    "Frontend is built with Vite + React + Tailwind and integrates shadcn/ui components and related lint/config tooling.",
    "Authentication is implemented via Internet Identity with dedicated hooks/utilities for identity/session and actor creation.",
    "Repository includes a reusable build-template workspace with Docker/deploy scripts and image processing scripts (resize/prune).",
    "Standalone implementation should be plain HTML + Tailwind CSS + vanilla JS (no React/ICP dependency) and use canvas-confetti for the celebration effect.",
    "Use a click counter (noCount) to drive No-button phrase cycling, GIF swapping, and Yes-button scaling per the provided formula (e.g., fontSize = (noCount * 20) + 16 + 'px')."
