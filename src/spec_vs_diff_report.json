  "summary": "All five requested Valentine UI requirements (REQ-12 through REQ-16) appear to be implemented: initial light/pink proposal screen with centered GIF/question/buttons, escalating deterministic “No” behavior with button resizing, GIF swap after a threshold, “Yes” success screen with exact heading and confetti via canvas-confetti, and Google Fonts loaded/applied with mobile-first centered layout. However, the diff also introduces unrequested changes (notably modifying main.tsx despite the immutable-path constraint) and adds footer/attribution content not asked for.",
